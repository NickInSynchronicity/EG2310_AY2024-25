# CDE2310 Week 7 Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
Each team will be assigned 20 minutes to present a PDR to the panel. The PDR shall detail the plan to execute the mission, and a high level technical brefing enough for the panel to concur that the proposed design is sound and feasible. 

## Presentation Format
The presentation shall take place in Studio 2 during the Tuesday and Thursday of Week 7 AY24/25. Presentation slots will be assigned in G2 session. G1-6 -> Tues, G7-13 -> Thurs.
Teams are allocated 30 minutes, which is broken down to 15 minutes presentation + 10 mins Q&A from the teaching team. 

### PDR Content
Given time constrain and limitations, teams can skip introduction and regurgitation of the mission document with the assumption that the panel is well aware of the team's profile and mission document.

The PDR shall include, but is not limited to the following recommend content (not listed in any particular order) for review

**Concept of Operations (ConOps)**
: Conops shall include the end to end process of the mission plan. This may include the process of setup, operational scenario, user interactions, mission logic for the turtlebot, contigency planning etc...

**System Requirements**
: This shall include the teams designed Functional Requirements and Systems Specifications. (note the difference)

**System Architecture and Design**
: Present major subsystems represented by block diagram and integration links. Which shall include
- Software algorithm design and logic diagram
- Electrical & Electronics Design and Power Budget
- Mechanical CAD, Fabrication and assembly plan
- Integration strategy
- Choice of components and justifications
- Any other information to highlight design choices

**Current Status and Next Steps**
: This shall include 
- an update of the team's prototyping progress
- proposed bill of materials and budget plan
- forseen upcomming challenges, and highlight any help required from teaching team/department

### Q&A
Teams can expect a 10 minute Q&A session where the panel might question any ambiguity of information or design flaws.

## PDR Rules
No fundamental calculation mistake that breaks the laws of physics is allowed to be presented during the PDR session. The teams shall be reminded that the PDR session is presented to highly competent engineers in their respective fields. Significant amount of time and preparation shall be spent to correct fundamental calculation presented as part of deriving systems requirements and specifications. The team shall be immediately disqualified from the PDR session upon any presentation of fundamental calculation error.

E.g. 
The team presents the design choice of a DC-DC buck converter. The team intent to supply 12V 1A into the component. The design then plans to apply a load of 5V 3A to the output of the converter. The team implies the buck converter has an effiency of more than 100%, which is unachievable. The PDR shall end immediately. 

## PDR Outcome
After concurrence from the panel on the presented design, the team can proceed to perform standard procurement procedure to purchase BOM items and start prototyping.

If the team fails the PDR, a re-PDR shall be arranged in week 8. 

## PDR Grades
PDR shall be 5% of Final score. Similar to G1, there is no detailed breakdown. Lets focus on the process.

All the best everyone!
